# Exercises: Modules and Functions

defmodule ModuleExercises do
  # Challenge 1: Named Function
  # Create a public function `circle_area/1` that receives the radius
  # and calculates the area (π * radius^2). You can use `3.14159` for π.

  # Challenge 2: Private Function
  # Create a private function `square/1` that calculates the square of a number.
  # Use this private function inside `circle_area/1`.

  # Challenge 3: Pipe Operator
  # Given a list of numbers, use the pipe operator to:
  # 1. Filter only the odd numbers.
  # 2. Square each odd number.
  # 3. Sum all the results.
  # Complete the `process_numbers/1` function.
  def process_numbers(list) do
    # Your code here
