# Exam: Collections and Enumerables

**1. What will be the result of the following expression?**
`Enum.reduce([1, 2, 3, 4], 0, fn x, acc -> x + acc end)`

a) `[1, 3, 6, 10]`
b) `10`
c) `0`
d) An error will occur.

**2. What does the `Enum.group_by/2` function do?**

a) Sorts the list according to a function.
b) Groups the elements of a collection into a map based on a key generated by a function.
c) Filters the list, keeping only the elements of a group.
d) Returns `true` if all elements belong to the same group.

**3. What is the main difference between `Enum` and `Stream`?**

a) `Enum` works with lists, `Stream` with maps.
b) `Enum` performs "eager" operations, `Stream` performs "lazy" operations.
c) `Stream` is faster for small collections.
d) `Enum` is for mathematical operations, `Stream` for text.

**4. What will the following expression return?**
`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] |> Stream.map(&(&1 * 10)) |> Stream.filter(&(rem(&1, 20) == 0)) |> Enum.take(2)`

a) `[20, 40]`
b) `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`
c) `[20, 40, 60, 80, 100]`
d) `[2, 4]`
