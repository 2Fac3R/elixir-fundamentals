# Exam Solutions: Collections and Enumerables

**1. What will be the result of the following expression?**
`Enum.reduce([1, 2, 3, 4], 0, fn x, acc -> x + acc end)`

- **Answer:** b) `10`
- **Explanation:** `Enum.reduce` iterates over the collection, accumulating a value. It starts with `0`. `1+0=1`, `2+1=3`, `3+3=6`, `4+6=10`.

**2. What does the `Enum.group_by/2` function do?**

- **Answer:** b) Groups the elements of a collection into a map based on a key generated by a function.
- **Explanation:** It is a very useful function for categorizing data. For example, grouping a list of users by their city.

**3. What is the main difference between `Enum` and `Stream`?**

- **Answer:** b) `Enum` performs "eager" operations, `Stream` performs "lazy" operations.
- **Explanation:** `Enum` calculates the complete result at each step. `Stream` builds a "recipe" of operations that only runs at the end (usually with a call to `Enum`), which is much more efficient for large or infinite collections.

**4. What will the following expression return?**
`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] |> Stream.map(&(&1 * 10)) |> Stream.filter(&(rem(&1, 20) == 0)) |> Enum.take(2)`

- **Answer:** a) `[20, 40]`
- **Explanation:**
  1. `Stream.map` creates a lazy stream `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`.
  2. `Stream.filter` creates a lazy stream that will only let `20` and `40` pass.
  3. `Enum.take(2)` executes the stream and stops as soon as it has found 2 elements that meet the conditions. The first element is `20` (from `2*10`), the second is `40` (from `4*10`).
